## First Generation

### Writing Your First Prompt

Start with descriptive, clear prompts:

```
Good: "A professional headshot of a confident businesswoman in a modern office, soft lighting, 35mm lens"

Avoid: "person at work"
```

### Enhance Your Prompts

Aura includes an **Enhance Prompt** feature to help improve your prompts automatically:

1. **Write your basic prompt** - Start with your core idea
2. **Click "Enhance Prompt"** - Let AI improve your prompt with better descriptions and technical details
3. **Review the enhanced version** - See how your prompt has been optimised
4. **Generate with confidence** - Use the enhanced prompt for better results

<Note>
The enhance prompt feature is particularly helpful for beginners who want to learn how to write more detailed, effective prompts.
</Note>

### Selecting Quality

- **High Quality**: Best results, more credits
- **Low Quality**: Faster generation, fewer credits

## Tips for Success

<Tip>
Start with simple prompts and gradually add more detail as you learn what works best.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Always check your credit balance before starting expensive generations.
