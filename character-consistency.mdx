## Character Creation vs Reference Images

<Note>
**Character Creation is only available for images** - not yet available for video generation. Video generation currently supports reference images only.
</Note>

### Character Creation (Images Only)
- **Upload**: 20-100 photos of the same person's face
- **Training**: AI learns the face and creates a consistent character
- **Usage**: Select your character and it appears in all new images
- **Best for**: Multiple images with the same person across different scenes

### Reference Images (Images & Videos)
- **Upload**: Single reference image to guide style and composition  
- **Usage**: "Recreate this photo with my character" or style guidance
- **Best for**: Copying specific poses, lighting, or compositions
