## Prompt Writing Guide

### Use the Enhance Prompt Feature

Aura includes an **Enhance Prompt** feature to help improve your prompts automatically:

1. **Write your basic prompt** - Start with your core idea
2. **Click "Enhance Prompt"** - Let AI improve your prompt with better descriptions and technical details
3. **Review the enhanced version** - See how your prompt has been optimised
4. **Generate with confidence** - Use the enhanced prompt for better results

</Note>

### Essential Elements

A great prompt includes:
- **Subject**: What is the main focus?
- **Setting**: Where is this taking place?
- **Style**: What's the artistic style or mood?
- **Technical**: Camera angle, lighting, lens type

### Example Prompts

## Advanced Techniques

### Image Formats
Aura Photo generates high-quality images that you can:
- Download directly from the interface
- Use for social media, professional work, or personal projects
- Share across different platforms

### Style Control
Add style keywords to your prompts:
- **Photography styles**: "film photography", "digital photography", "polaroid"
- **Lighting**: "golden hour", "studio lighting", "natural light"
- **Mood**: "dramatic", "soft", "vibrant", "moody"

### Character Mode vs Reference Images

**Character Mode:**
- Upload 20-100 pictures of a face to create a character
- When character mode is selected, it uses that consistent face in all new AI images you create
- Perfect for creating multiple images with the same person/character

**Reference Images:**
- Upload a single reference image to recreate a similar photo
- Say "recreate this photo with my character" and it will create a very similar image to the reference
- The face/body will be replaced with your selected character, but the pose, setting, and composition will match the reference
- Great for recreating specific scenes or poses with your character

<Note>
Character mode requires training on multiple photos of the same face, while reference images are for recreating specific compositions and poses.
